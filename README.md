You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  DIRECTORY_PATH/DIRECTORY_NAME

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Hosting: Configure and
deploy Firebase Hosting sites

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: FIREBASE_PROJECT_NAME

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? DIST_FOLDER
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
+  Wrote dist/index.html

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

+  Firebase initialization complete!
